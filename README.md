# Project Title: 3.10 Math Trick
### Purpose: A silly math trick.
### Version: 1.0.0 - Date: 10/28/2025
### Authors: SaxbyMod

## About the Project:
### Comparing Java to C#
C# has a `.toString()` whilst Java does `String.valueOf()` instead.
### What was this project made for?
Just a lesson in my AP Computer Science; Advanced class. Why this was posted to GitHub [if it was] is likely because I wanted to keep the code for future reference. This is a silly math trick made for the end of the unit project.
### What are things that could have been better?
remember that switches utilize switch (var) around the type rather than just switch var, I don't know why but I just forgot ()'s were needed, its like this normally in C# too :shrug:
